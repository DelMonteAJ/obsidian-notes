## Notes

- [ ] Learn how (AND WHEN) to get to the hotel and from the hotel to the parks
- [ ] Picking a deluxe resort grants extended evening hours, so 2 additional hours after closing
- [ ] Staying at a resort allows us to get in the park 30 minutes before it opens for everyone else
- [ ] Double check park hours EVERYDAY
- [ ] Find out how to use the memory maker (IMPORTANT)
    - [ ] Apparently looks as if it supports unlimited photos from random locations and rides (verify this future AJ) ~ AJ 6/17/23
- [ ] Check restaurant menu’s to plan reservations
    - [ ] Remember that the menu’s change often so look before committing (wait until closer to arrival day)
    - [ ] Find multiple things on the menu that you would like to eat in case something is not available during the reservation
    - [ ] If we decide not to eat there, the last day to cancel without $10/person fee is the day before the reservation, or modify and push it back to later that evening or tomorrow.
- [ ] Check Shop Disney website to potentially find a discount with merchandise inside of the park
    - [ ] Additional shopping locations (official park merchandise, just overstock)
        - [ ] Disney Character Warehouse outside of the Disney bubble area - Orlando Outlet Marketplace (International Dr)
        - [ ] Disney Character Warehouse Orlando Vineland Premium Outlet - (Vineland Avenue
- [ ] Pickup a Disney Springs brochure and go to Luxury of Time Diamonds International for a free necklace.
- [ ] Sign up for accounts at some places located at Disney Springs before going for free birthday stuff

## Resources

- [ ] MagicBand+ (for handling tickets and using for getting into room)
- [ ] Apps to Use
    - [ ] My Disney Experience
    - [ ] Genie+ (Lightning Lane and joining virtual queues)
        - [ ] Can be bought starting at Midnight on the day of the visit
        - [ ] Lightning Lanes go live at 7 AM (so before the parks even open) TREAT IT LIKE A PAIR OF SHOES
        - [ ] You can only book one Lightning Lane at a time, pick the priority rides
            - [ ] You can stack reservations after 2 hours starting when the park opens (120 minutes)
        - [ ] Not as effective at Epcot and Animal Kingdom due to shorter lines and not as many rides
    - [ ] Research which apps to use
- [ ] Things to Bring
    - [ ] Reusable water bottle (may need to be clear)
- [ ] Pre-purchases (buy before going to park)
    
    - [ ] Umbrellas
    - [ ] Ponchos
    - [ ] Snacks (that we can buy at a regular store like normal, not-Disney exclusives)

Probably would be advisable to not get an electric car since the charge price may be similar to gas near Orlando. But this may allow for reduced strain while driving since breaks will be taken.
