## Things to Do

- Apply to as many schools as possible
- Think about doing directed readings at UAB
- Things I Can Do
    - Go to academic conferences and make connections
        - How to network at conferences
            - See if they have any related talks and use that as a bridge to discuss further
        - For me since I am new
            - Just go to learn something new
            - Ask really good questions during portions where questions are allowed
            - Walk up to the panelist after their talk and ask more about their research
            - ASK QUESTIONS AND TALK TO PEOPLE
    - Consider a national lab position for research purposes
    - Consider taking a gap before starting the PhD

## Things to Have

- Research Experience (really important)
    - Talk about anything research-y that I have done,
- Letters of Recommendation (really important)
    - From people I have worked with very closely (more from academia side than industry)
        - Would you be willing to write me a strong letter of recommendation for graduate school
    - The person who writes it matters more than what it actually contains.
    - Talk about my skills that would be nice to have for research projects
- Research Statement
- Personal Statement (may be same as a research statement)
    
    - List different labs or people you would like to work under
    - Don’t summarize your CV, just connect the relevant points to the statement
    - Add diversity, (this is what is missing in the field, here is what I can add, leverage that I am an African-American male that has been seen as a minority through all levels of education, from high-school to my college courses, also what I am going to do to promote diversity and help the diverse background that I come from.)
