Ingredients

- [ ] 2 small packs (or 1 medium) of ground beef
- [ ] 1 bag of Waffle Fries
- [ ] Salt
- [ ] Pepper
- [ ] Garlic Powder
- [ ] Onion Powder
- [ ] Chili Powder
- [ ] Cavender’s Greek Seasoning
- [ ] 1 egg (can be substituted with ranch)
- [ ] Hamburger buns

Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
2. Spread waffle fries across a thin pan.
    - This ensures that the fries turn out crispy.
3. Place all ground beef into a singular container with ranch and season.
    - Use a small amount of ranch, add additional if the burgers are falling apart while shaping.
    - Season to heart’s content.
4. Combine ground beef and other ingredients until homogenous.
    - Best to combine with a utensil until ranch is integrated, then a hand can be used.
5. Double line a wide pan with paper towels.
    - This will be used to contain cooked burgers.
6. Place waffle fries in the oven on the top rack until crispy.
    - Do not cook the fries until it is time for the burgers to be cooked.
        - This ensures that the fries will be hot whenever the burgers are done.
    - To accelerate cooking, place on bottom row since it is closer to the heat source.
7. Grab a fist full of ground beef and place in well oiled frying pan on slightly above medium heat.
    - When crafting the patty, aim for the shape of a slightly large baseball.
    - When cooking, remember to make them large since the meat will shrink due to being cooked.
    - When cooking all burgers, make sure to check the current cooking side to see if it crispy and needs to be flipped.
    - If the burger is getting too small or crispy too fast, add some water near the end of the burger’s cook.
        - This will create a lot of steam but will make the burger juicy, remove the burger when the water is mostly absorbed and burger is crispy.
    - Scrape out excess meat prior to starting the next burger.
    - Place a slice of cheese on the finished burger while it is still hot and cooling down.
